        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The Dutch Historical Shipping Association
          Museum was founded in 1916 and owner of one of
          the world's leading maritime collections,
          a direct consequence of the success of the first
          Dutch exhibition on shipping in 1913.
          The approximately 300,000 objects come from shipping companies,
          collectors and enthusiasts from the maritime and
          naval world. Originally the museum was located
          in a building on the corner Cornelis Schuytstraat / De laires-
          street in Amsterdam South, until 2018 auction house Christie's. The
          original function can still be seen in the wave motifs in
          the brick facade. Since 1973 the museum has been located in
          's Lands Zeemagazijn at the Oosterdok near the IJ
          in Amsterdam. Crown Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands
          reopened the museum in April of that year on the new
          Location.

        <h2>Exhibiton</h2>
        <h3>west wing</h3>
        <h4>Amsterdam port city</h4>
        The Amsterdam port city exhibition shows the age-old relationship between the port and the city,
        from the moment a dam was built in the Amstel until the future.
        <h4>The Story of the Whale</h4>
        The exhibition 'the story of the whale' shows how we have looked at the whale through the ages.
        You will learn about whaling and how it has made whales an endangered species.
        <h4>map</h4>
        The Maritime Museum uses the four cardinal directions.
        The Open Square is your starting point. The Exhibitions are located in the north, east and west.
        After visiting a 'wind direction' you will return to the Open Square.

        <h3>north wing</h3>
        <h4>-Willem van de Velde & Son</h4>
        The Maritime Museum presents a unique large retrospective about father and son Willem van de Velde,
        two leading sea painters in the seventeenth century, each with their own specialism: pen painting and oil
        painting.
        <h4>Main Gallery: Republic by the Sea</h4>
        The Republic by the Sea exhibition shows how the Netherlands was formed as a maritime nation.
        On the basis of more than 50 masterpieces, the exhibition tells the story of the Republic in the 17th and 18th
        centuries.
        The Main Gallery is the starting point for a museum visit.
        <h4>Dare to discover | a VR journey</h4>
        Travel through time? It's possible in Het Scheepvaartmuseum!
        Go back to the seventeenth century with the spectacular Virtual Reality time travel 'dare to discover â€“ a VR
        journey'.
        The VR can be seen on board the VOC ship Amsterdam.
        <h4>king sloop</h4>
        200 years ago, King William I ordered a royal vessel to be built.
        At this time, richly decorated rowing boats were a 'must have' for European monarchs.
        As a maritime nation par excellence, a royal rowing sloop also suited the Netherlands perfectly.
        <h4>VOC Ship Amsterdam</h4>
        The VOC ship Amsterdam is moored at the jetty of the museum.
        <h4>Steamship Christiaan Brunings</h4>
        The steamship Christiaan Brunings, an icebreaker from 1900, is moored at the jetty of Het Scheepvaartmuseum.
        The ship had been written off for scrapping, but Rijkswaterstaat took the initiative in 1968 to save the ship
        and give it new life.

        <h3>east wing</h3>
        <h4>Cartography & Cursio</h4>
        Cartography & Curiosa depicts the encounter with a new world.
        You can see how Dutch navigators from the 17th century found their way and how these voyages determined the
        European world view.
        <h4>The yacht models</h4>
        As early as the seventeenth century, people who could afford it liked to show off their richly decorated yachts.
        We show an enormous diversity of yacht models.
        <h4>Navigation - Instruments</h4>
        Seafarers know it all: there is no more beautiful place in the world to view our starry sky than at sea.
        Especially if they help you find your place - with the help of navigation instruments.
        <h4>The ship ornaments</h4>
        Raw beauty and pure craftsmanship within sight of the harbour.
        The most beautiful ship ornaments and ship decorations can be seen in the east wing of Het Scheepvaartmuseum.
        <h4>Free audio tour</h4>
        Discover the stories behind our most beautiful objects in just one hour with our free audio tour.
        <h4>A long-lost manuscript</h4>
        The 400th anniversary of the genocide on the Banda Islands is the reason for Het Scheepvaartmuseum to research
        and present a manuscript about the history of the islands.
        A Malay manuscript from the collection was published in 1922 by M.S.
        (Saleh) Neirabatij written and can be seen in a mini-exhibition in Het Scheepvaartmuseum and accessible online.

        These are the Exhibitions that are coming up in short all together.

          The Scheepsvaart museum is always very promising.
          It is spacious and the courtyard was this time decorated with the beautiful colorful jellyfish.
